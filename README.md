# Tweeting-Stock-Markets
This repository shows how I wrote my bachelor thesis "Tweeting Stock Markets" using Python.  Objective of this analysis was to find out how market sentiment on Twitter could explain stock market movements on the German DAX 40 and the US S&amp;P 40.

The package used to scrape Tweets without access to the official Twitter API was: snscrape.

Sentiment analysis was conducted with https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment hosted on Azure Servers.

Statistical testing with statsmodels.
